Again, a Big Bento Redux post...

That had to do with this FUCKING browser. It was so broken. Winamp.com, some mp3 blogs and AOL crap were dead. The problem was that I couldn't modify the browser, cuz the line on the xml file was about showing the Core's browser. Thankfully, after digging around some old WASDP's I found the god-savior file, the browser.m. You think that I had a good time modifing it? NO! Since, I had to add alternative websites, I couldn't find lots of, cuz of, FUCKING INTERNET DESTROYER. The most of the sites were not supported, but I added them. You don't want to know what followed next :/

I have to remove the Media Monitor :( and fix the init_browser.m file.
