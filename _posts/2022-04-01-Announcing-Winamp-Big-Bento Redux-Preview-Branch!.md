# Announcing Winamp Big Bento Redux Preview Branch!

Hello Llamas!
The exams are going to start soon and since my time is limited, I have to upload and do my latest work fast, and then go and study ;)

Thanks to a git script I made, any latest work I have completed or I have unfinished will be uploaded to the [preview](https://github.com/SecurityRaven/Winamp-BigBentoREDUX/tree/preview) branch. 

So, will the preview versions be stable?

Hmmm... Yee and Nah. You see, some things that will be updated, there is a chance that they won't be tested. For example the 1.2.9's latest preview I have uploaded, it is "stable". More details and changelog soon!
